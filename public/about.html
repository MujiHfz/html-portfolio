<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mujtahid Hafizuddin Hussain Bin Zakir Hussain. I am a Malaysian. Currently working as a Senior Superintendent at LonGi Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.<br />
I have been working for almost 4 years now and i am eager to learn new things.</p>

<p>I am still new regarding programming so i took online classes to learn during my free time.
  I am a fast learner and easy to blend in with other. I have a lot of achievements during my work at LonGi.
  One of it is being the best shift leader and also the best Manufacturing Engineer.
</p>

<p>I am willing to work in a programming world, as my idol is Tony Stark. Hopefully, one day i will be able to  create things just like Tony Stark.</p>
